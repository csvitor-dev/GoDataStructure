# Implementation Tutorial

> This tutorial will serve to detail the implementation of one of the data structures (in this case, the **Singly Linked List**), which is the foundation for many other data structures!

The main reason for this implementation (besides revisiting the same learnings I had in **Clang**) is to show how _pointer_ manipulation works! So, don't forget to review [this topic](./TUTORIAL.md).
